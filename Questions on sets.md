### How `HashSet` Ensures Uniqueness of Elements

`HashSet` relies on two methods—`hashCode()` and `equals()`—to ensure that all elements within the set are unique. Here’s how it works:

1. **hashCode()**:
   - Each object in Java has a `hashCode()` method, which `HashSet` uses to compute the hash code of elements. When an object is added to a `HashSet`, it calculates its hash code to determine the "bucket" (location) in memory where it should be stored.
   - If two objects have the same hash code, they may end up in the same bucket. This situation is called a "hash collision."

2. **equals()**:
   - When two objects have the same hash code, `HashSet` uses the `equals()` method to check if they are indeed the same object or just have the same hash code by coincidence.
   - If `equals()` returns `true`, it means the objects are identical in terms of content, so the new object will not be added to the set.
   - If `equals()` returns `false`, even if they have the same hash code, the objects are considered different, and the new object can be added to the set.

This combination of `hashCode()` and `equals()` ensures that `HashSet` can efficiently identify duplicate elements and maintain uniqueness.

### What is an `EnumSet`, and How is it Different from Other `Set` Implementations?

`EnumSet` is a specialized `Set` implementation optimized for enums. Here are its key characteristics and differences from other sets:

1. **Only for Enums**:
   - `EnumSet` is designed exclusively for use with enum types. It cannot store other types of objects, making it a specialized tool for managing enums.

2. **Efficient Implementation**:
   - Internally, `EnumSet` uses bitwise operations to store enum constants, leveraging the fact that enums are finite and typically few in number. Each enum constant is represented by a bit in an integer or long, making operations like add, remove, and contains extremely fast compared to other set implementations.

3. **Memory Efficiency**:
   - Since `EnumSet` uses a compact bit-vector representation, it consumes less memory than other `Set` implementations like `HashSet` or `TreeSet`. It’s especially efficient for storing small sets of enum constants.

4. **Performance**:
   - `EnumSet` is generally faster than other sets for operations involving enums. Bitwise operations allow it to perform common operations in constant time, making it much faster than `HashSet` or `LinkedHashSet` for enum-specific tasks.

In summary, `EnumSet` is optimized for enums and provides a highly efficient, memory-saving, and fast alternative to other `Set` implementations when working with enums.

Here are some commonly asked interview questions on `Set`:

### Conceptual Questions

1. **What makes `HashSet` not thread-safe? How would you make it thread-safe?**
   - `HashSet` is not synchronized, so concurrent modifications by multiple threads can lead to data corruption. To make it thread-safe, you can wrap it with `Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<>())` or use `ConcurrentSkipListSet`, which is thread-safe and sorted.

2. **How does `HashSet` handle collisions, and what happens if too many collisions occur?**
   - `HashSet` uses chaining for collision resolution, where entries with the same hash code are stored in linked lists within the same bucket. If the load factor (default is 0.75) is exceeded, the hash table is resized to reduce collisions.

3. **What are the time complexities of add, remove, and contains operations in `HashSet` and `TreeSet`?**
   - `HashSet` has an average O(1) time complexity for add, remove, and contains operations, while `TreeSet` has O(log n) for these operations due to its underlying Red-Black tree structure.

4. **Can two different objects be considered equal in a `HashSet`? How?**
   - Yes, if two objects have the same `hashCode()` and are considered equal by the `equals()` method, `HashSet` considers them duplicates and will only store one instance.

5. **How would you implement a custom `Comparator` for `TreeSet`?**
   - You can create a custom `Comparator` class implementing the `Comparator` interface, then pass an instance of this comparator to the `TreeSet` constructor to define a custom sorting order.

### Scenario-Based Questions

6. **In a high-performance application, would you use `HashSet` or `TreeSet`? Why?**
   - Use `HashSet` for higher performance if sorting isn’t required, as it provides O(1) average time complexity for lookups, adds, and deletes, compared to `TreeSet`'s O(log n).

7. **If you have to frequently check for the existence of an element, which `Set` implementation would you choose?**
   - `HashSet` is preferred because of its constant time complexity for lookups on average.

8. **How would you remove duplicates from a collection of elements while also sorting them?**
   - Use a `TreeSet`, which removes duplicates and sorts the elements automatically.

9. **If you need a set that maintains insertion order and is synchronized, which combination would you use?**
   - Use `Collections.synchronizedSet(new LinkedHashSet<>());`, which will maintain insertion order and provide synchronized access.

10. **Explain a scenario where using a `Set` instead of a `List` can significantly improve performance.**
    - When collecting unique identifiers (like user IDs or product IDs) and ensuring no duplicates exist, `Set` improves performance because it prevents duplicates and allows efficient lookups without sorting or ordering requirements.
